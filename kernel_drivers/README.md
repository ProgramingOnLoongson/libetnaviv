This collection of kernel drivers is provided for information only. I have not tried building them.

It is likely that this is possible, but it may require some serious work porting either of them to your version of Linux.

If you have a device with Linux or Android with a Vivante GPU, your best bet is to find (or ask for) the GPL drivers for your specific device.
These may be older (or newer) than the ones provided here but at least you're sure they work with your device.
